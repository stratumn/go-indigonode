## Project Status

The current focus is to build a solid architecture to develop P2P services.

### Current features

* uses IPFS's go-libp2p library
* core services (P2P, NAT, DHT routing, relay, etc...)
* P2P bootstrapping from seed nodes
* gRPC API
* neat and powerful inner-process service based architecture
* CLI with gRPC command reflection
* system test framework
* nice logs
* Prometheus metrics

### Next

* ability to create and join multiple private or public P2P services
* Proof-Of-Work for public blockchains
* Proof-Of-Authority for consortiums
* a simple, script-less, digital asset
* Indigo integration (compatibility with Tendermint ABCI?)

## Installation

Install Go. On macOS, you can install using `homebrew`:

```bash
$ brew install go
```

Install Go dependencies:

```bash
$ make deps
```

Compile and install `alice`:

```bash
$ go install
```

## Usage

Create a new directory. Open a terminal in that directory then create
configuration files using `alice init`:

```bash
$ alice init
```

Now you can launch a node (from the same directory):

```bash
$ alice up
```

Open another terminal and connect to the node (from the same directory):

```bash
$ alice cli
```

## Logs And Metrics

To view streaming logs (from the same directory):

```bash
$ alice log -f log.jsonld
```

To view metrics you need to install Prometheus. On macOS:

```bash
$ brew install prometheus
```

Then copy `prometheus.yml` and launch Prometheus:

```bash
$ prometheus
```

By default, Prometheus is available at `http://localhost:9090`.

To create dashboards, check out [grafana](https://grafana.com).
