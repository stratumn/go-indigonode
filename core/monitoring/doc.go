// Package monitoring contains thin wrappers around the monitoring libraries
// used.
//
// Its goal is not to create a completely new metrics/trace abstraction but
// rather to minimize places where the underlying monitoring libraries are
// directly used to make it easy to replace them if needed with the help
// of the compiler.
// Packages that expose metrics should define those metrics in a metrics.go
// file which would be the only file in the package to import OpenCensus.
// The rest of the package would use our monitoring wrappers to record metrics.
