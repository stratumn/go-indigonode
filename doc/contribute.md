## Issues

Limit the number of issues. Don't create issues for every idea you have. We
want to avoid issues that remain open for a long time and pollute the kanban
board. Issues should be for bugs and things that will be implemented in the
short term. If you have a good idea but it's not a priority, you will remember
it when the time comes. It's not necessary to create an issue for everything
you are working on.

## Code Reviews

* Check conventions are respected.
* Check for typos, punctuation, and other obvious mistakes.
* Aim for fast merges to the master branch to reduce friction.
* Some improvements are better left for other pull requests.
