# Extend Stratumn Node By Writing Your Own Service

Great care went into making Stratumn Node extendable with minimum hassle.
The core of Stratumn Node handles service dependencies and configuration files.
Extending the API is a little more work but it's still very reasonable,
and the CLI uses reflection to automatically add new commands,
so you don't have to worry about that part.

## Implement Service interfaces

Adding new services to your Stratumn Node is easy.
A service needs to implement at least the three methods of the `Service`
interface (`ID`, `Name`, and `Desc`).
You can start from this template, which implements all the most commonly used
interfaces:

```go
package myservice

import (
    "context"

    "github.com/pkg/errors"

    logging "github.com/ipfs/go-log"
)

// log is the logger for the service.
var log = logging.Logger("myservice")

// Service is the My Service service.
type Service struct {
    config *Config
}

// Config contains configuration options for the My Service service.
type Config struct {
    // Example is an example setting.
    Example string `toml:"example" comment:"Example setting."`
}

// ID returns the unique identifier of the service.
func (s *Service) ID() string {
    return "myservice"
}

// Name returns the human friendly name of the service.
func (s *Service) Name() string {
    return "My Service"
}

// Desc returns a description of what the service does.
func (s *Service) Desc() string {
    return "My own little service."
}

// Config returns the current service configuration or creates one with
// good default values.
func (s *Service) Config() interface{} {
    if s.config != nil {
        return *s.config
    }

    // Set the default configuration settings of your service here.
    return Config{
        Example: "Default value",
    }
}

// SetConfig configures the service handler.
func (s *Service) SetConfig(config interface{}) error {
    conf := config.(Config)
    s.config = &conf
    return nil
}

// Needs returns the set of services this service depends on.
func (s *Service) Needs() map[string]struct{} {
    // If your service depends on other services, specify them here.
    // For example, if you need the "manager" service:
    //
    // return map[string]struct{}{
    //     "manager": struct{}{}
    // }
    return nil
}

// Plug sets the connected services.
func (s *Service) Plug(services map[string]interface{}) error {
    // If your service depends on other services, it will be given what those
    // services exposed here. For example:
    //
    // var ok
    // s.mgr, ok = services["manager"].(*manager.Manager)
    // if !ok {
    //     return errors.New("invalid manager type")
    // }
    return nil
}

// Expose exposes the service to other services.
func (s *Service) Expose() interface{} {
    // If you want to expose something to other services, this is the place to
    // do it. For example:
    //
    // return s.mgr
    return nil
}

// Run starts the service.
func (s *Service) Run(ctx context.Context, running, stopping func()) error {
// Initialize the service before calling running().

    running()

    // Start any long running process with a goroutine here.

    // Handle exit conditions.
    select {
    case <-ctx.Done():
    // ...
    }

    stopping()

    // Stop the service after calling stopping().

    return errors.WithStack(ctx.Err())
}
```

It should be self-explanatory if you are experienced with the Go programming
language.

## Register your Service

To build `stratumn-node` with your service included, all you have to do is
register your package somewhere. For instance the core services are registered
in `core/service.go`:

package core

import (
    "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/manager"
    bootstrap "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/bootstrap/service"
    connmgr "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/connmgr/service"
    grpcapi "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/grpcapi/service"
    host "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/host/service"
    identify "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/identify/service"
    kaddht "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/kaddht/service"
    monitoring "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/monitoring/service"
    mssmux "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/mssmux/service"
    natmgr "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/natmgr/service"
    ping "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/ping/service"
    pruner "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/pruner/service"
    relay "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/relay/service"
    signal "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/signal/service"
    swarm "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/swarm/service"
    yamux "github.com/stratumn/go-node/core/app/yamux/service"
)

// BuiltinServices returns all the builtin services.
func BuiltinServices() []manager.Service {
    return []manager.Service{
        &bootstrap.Service{},
        &clock.Service{},
        &connmgr.Service{},
        &grpcapi.Service{},
        &host.Service{},
        &identify.Service{},
        &kaddht.Service{},
        &monitoring.Service{},
        &mssmux.Service{},
        &natmgr.Service{},
        &ping.Service{},
        &pruner.Service{},
        &relay.Service{},
        &signal.Service{},
        &swarm.Service{},
        &yamux.Service{},
    }
}
```

## Migrations

Updating the configuration structure should be done via migrations.
Migrations ensure that existing nodes can easily update their binary
and run `stratumn-node up` without errors.

If your service has configuration options, you should add a migration to add
them to the config file. The migrations for the core Stratumn Node modules are
in `core/migrate.go`. You can append one for your service:

```go
var migrations = []cfg.MigrateHandler{

    // Previous migrations...

    func(tree *cfg.Tree) error {
        return tree.Set("myservice.option", "value")
    },
}
```

## Start your Service

After registering your service, you can build `stratumn-node` using `make install`.

You should now be able to start your service from the CLI using
`manager-start myservice`.

## Extending The API/CLI

The extend the API, you must first implement a [gRPC](https://grpc.io) service.

Then your service can implement the `Registrable` interface:

```go
// Registrable represents something that can add itself to the gRPC server, so
// that other services can add functions to the API.
type Registrable interface {
    AddToGRPCServer(*grpc.Server)
}
```

All you need to do is add a `AddToGRPCServer(*grpc.Server)` function to your
service. For instance:

```go
// AddToGRPCServer adds the service to a gRPC server.
func (s *Service) AddToGRPCServer(gs *grpc.Server) {
    pb.RegisterMyServiceServer(gs, myGRPCServer{s})
}
```

The `grpcapi` service automatically looks for services that implement
`Registrable` and registers them on the gRPC server.

You don't need to manually add commands to the CLI. Using `reflection`, the CLI
inspects the services available on the gRPC server, and automatically creates
commands for them when it connects to the API. Keep in mind that currently it
is only able to reflect very basic gRPC methods and types.

## Interfaces Compatible With The Service Manager

The service manager understands the following interfaces:

```go
// Copyright © 2017-2018 Stratumn SAS
//
// This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
// it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as
// published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the
// License, or (at your option) any later version.
//
// This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
// but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
// MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
// GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
//
// You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
// along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

// Service describes a Stratumn Node service.
type Service interface {
    // ID returns a unique identifier.
    ID() string

    // Name returns a user friendly name.
    Name() string

    // Desc returns a short description of what the service does.
    Desc() string
}

// Needy depends on other services.
type Needy interface {
    // Needs returns a set of service identifiers needed before this
    // service can start.
    Needs() map[string]struct{}
}

// Pluggable connects other services.
type Pluggable interface {
    Needy

    // Plug is given a map of exposed connected objects, giving the handler
    // a chance to use them. It must check that the types are correct, or
    // return an error.
    Plug(exposed map[string]interface{}) error
}

// Friendly can befriend other services, but doesn't depend on them.
type Friendly interface {
    // Likes returns a set of service identifiers this service can
    // befriend.
    Likes() map[string]struct{}

    // Befriend is called every time a service it likes just started
    // running or is about to stop. If it just started running, it is
    // passed the exposed object. If it is about to stop, nil is given.
    // It must check that the exposed type is valid before using it.
    Befriend(serviceID string, exposed interface{})
}

// Exposer exposes a type to other services.
type Exposer interface {
    // Expose exposes a type to other services. Services that depend on
    // this service will receive the returned object in their Plug method
    // if they have one. Services that are friendly with this services will
    // receive the returned object in their Befriend method.
    Expose() interface{}
}

// Runner runs a function.
type Runner interface {
    // Run should start the service. It should block until the service is
    // done or the context is canceled. It should call running() once it
    // has started, and stopping() when it begins stopping.
    Run(ctx context.Context, running, stopping func()) error
}
```
